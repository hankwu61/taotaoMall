## **_The input design is the link between the information system and the user. It comprises developing specification and procedure for data preparation and those steps that are necessary to put transaction data into a usable form for processing data entry. The activity of putting data into the computer for processing can be achieved by instructing the computer to read data from a written or printed document or it can occur by having people key data directly into the system. The design of inputs focuses on controlling the amount of inputs required, controlling errors, avoiding delay, avoiding extra steps and keeping the process simple._** {#the-input-design-is-the-link-between-the-information-system-and-the-user-it-comprises-developing-specification-and-procedure-for-data-preparation-and-those-steps-that-are-necessary-to-put-transaction-data-into-a-usable-form-for-processing-data-entry-the-activity-of-putting-data-into-the-computer-for-processing-can-be-achieved-by-instructing-the-computer-to-read-data-from-a-written-or-printed-document-or-it-can-occur-by-having-people-key-data-directly-into-the-system-the-design-of-inputs-focuses-on-controlling-the-amount-of-inputs-required-controlling-errors-avoiding-delay-avoiding-extra-steps-and-keeping-the-process-simple}
