## **_Testing presents an interesting challenge for the software engineers attempt to build software from an abstract concept to an acceptable implementation. In testing engineer create a series of test cases that occurs when errors are uncovered. Testing is the process of executing a program for finding errors. A good test is one that has the high probability of finding an uncovered error. A successful error is one that uncovers undiscovered errors._** {#testing-presents-an-interesting-challenge-for-the-software-engineers-attempt-to-build-software-from-an-abstract-concept-to-an-acceptable-implementation-in-testing-engineer-create-a-series-of-test-cases-that-occurs-when-errors-are-uncovered-testing-is-the-process-of-executing-a-program-for-finding-errors-a-good-test-is-one-that-has-the-high-probability-of-finding-an-uncovered-error-a-successful-error-is-one-that-uncovers-undiscovered-errors}
