**SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE**

Feasibililty Analysis

Feasibility study is done so that an ill-conceived system is recognized early in definition phase. During system engineering, however, we concentrate our attention on four primary areas of interest. This phase is really important as before starting with the real work of building the system it was very important to find out whether the idea thought is possible or not.

*   Economic Feasibility: An evaluation of development cost weighted against the ultimate income or benefit derived from the developed system.
*   Technical Feasibility: A study of function, performance and constraints that may affect the ability to achieve an acceptable system.
*   Operational Feasibility: A study about the operational aspects of the system.

Economic Analysis

Among the most important information contained in feasibility study is Cost Benefit Analysis and assessment of the economic justification for a computer based system project. Cost Benefit Analysis delineates costs for the project development and weighs them against tangible and intangible benefits of a system. Cost Benefits Analysis is complicated by the criteria that vary with the characteristics of the system to be developed, the relative size of the project and the expected return on investment desired as part of company’s strategic plan. In addition, many benefits derived from a computer-based system are intangible (e.g. better design quality through iterative optimization, increased customer satisfaction through programmable control etc.)As this is an in-house project for the company, to be used for its own convenience and also it is not that big a project. So neither it requires a huge amount of money nor any costly tools or infrastructure need to be set up for it.

Technical Analysis

During technical analysis, the technical merits of the system are studied and at the same time collecting additional information about performance, reliability, maintainability and predictability.

Technical analysis begins with an assessment of the technical viability of the proposed system.

*   What technologies are required to accomplished system function and performance?
*   What new materials, methods, algorithms or processes are required and what is their development risk?
*   How will these obtained from technical analysis form the basis for another go/no-go decision on the test system? If the technical risk is severe, if models indicate that the desired function can not be achieved, if the pieces just won’t fit together smoothly-it’s back to the drawing board.

As the software is vary much economically feasible, then it is really important for it to be technically sound. The software will be build among:

*   MS SQL SERVER as Back End
*   ASP.NET as Front End

Operational Feasibility

The project is operationally feasible. This project is being made for the convenience of the patients and doctors only. This system will greatly reduce a huge burden of doctors. So because of the above stated advantages the users of the system will not be reluctant at all.

SYSTEM ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION:

System analysis is the process of studying the business processors and procedures, generally referred to as business systems, to see how they can operate and whether improvement is needed.

This may involve examining data movement and storage, machines and technology used in the system, programs that control the machines, people providing inputs, doing the processing and receiving the outputs.

INVESTIGATION PHASE

The investigation phase is also known as the fact-finding stage or the analysis of the current system. This is a detailed study conducted with the purpose of wanting to fully understand the existing system and to identify the basic information requirements. Various techniques may be used in fact-finding and all fact obtained must be recorded.

A thorough investigation was done in every effected aspect when determining whether the purposed system is feasible enough to be implemented.

INVESTIGATION

As it was essential for us to find out more about the present system, we used the following methods to gather the information: -

1\. Observation: - Necessary to see the way the system works first hand.

2 Document sampling: - These are all the documents that are used in the system. They are necessary to check all the data that enters and leaves the system.

3 Questionnaires: - These were conducted to get views of the other employees who are currently employed in the system.

ANALYSIS OF THE INVESTIGATION

_Strengths of the System_

1\. No complex equipment: - The equipment that is used is very simple and no special skills have to be mastered to be able to operate the system. Therefore no training is required for the employees.

2\. Low cost: - There is little money spent in maintaining the present system other than buying the necessary office equipment and the ledgers.

CONSTRAINTS AND LIMITATIONS

The constraints and limitation within a system are the drawbacks that occur during the implementation of the system. These limitations and constraints can crop up in almost every system; the most important fact is to find a way to overcome these problems.

Software design is the first of three technical activities – design, code generation, and test that are required to build and verify the software. Each activity transforms information in manner that ultimately results in validated computer software.

The design task produces a data design, an architectural design, an interface design and component design.

The design of an information system produces the details that clearly describe how a system will meet the requirements identified during system analysis. The system design process is not a step by step adherence of clear procedures and guidelines. When I started working on system design, I face different types of problems; many of these are due to constraints imposed by the user or limitations of hardware and software available. Some times it was quite difficult to enumerate that complexity of the problems and solutions thereof since the variety of likely problems is so great and no solutions are exactly similar however the following consideration I kept in mind during design phased.

Design objectives:-

The primary objective of the design is to deliver the requirements as specified in the feasibility report. These are the some of the objectives, which I kept in mind.

*   Practicality: The system is quite stable and can be operated by the people with average intelligence.
*   Efficiency: I tried to involve accuracy, timeliness and comprehensiveness of the system output.
*   Cost: It is desirable to aim for the system with a minimum cost subject to the condition that it must satisfy the entire requirement.
*   Flexibility: I have tried that the system should be modifiable depending on the changing needs of the user. Such modifications should entail extensive reconstructing or recreation of software. It should also be portable to different computer systems.
*   Security: This is very important aspect which I followed in this designing phase and tried to covers the areas of hardware reliability, fallback procedures, and physical security of data.
