## **_Unit testing focuses verification effort on the smallest unit of software design module. This uncovers errors within the boundary of a module. Unit testing is actually White box testing both the external things as well as the internal codes are tested. In testing, the interfaces are tested in order to ensure the proper flow of data in and out of the module. The boundary testing is done to ensure that the module keeps the limit of it. All independent paths are tested to ensure that all statements are tested at least once. At last the error path is also tested._** {#unit-testing-focuses-verification-effort-on-the-smallest-unit-of-software-design-module-this-uncovers-errors-within-the-boundary-of-a-module-unit-testing-is-actually-white-box-testing-both-the-external-things-as-well-as-the-internal-codes-are-tested-in-testing-the-interfaces-are-tested-in-order-to-ensure-the-proper-flow-of-data-in-and-out-of-the-module-the-boundary-testing-is-done-to-ensure-that-the-module-keeps-the-limit-of-it-all-independent-paths-are-tested-to-ensure-that-all-statements-are-tested-at-least-once-at-last-the-error-path-is-also-tested}
