## **_COMPARISON OF ASP AND ASP.NET:_** {#comparison-of-asp-and-asp-net}

*   Classic ASP was built on the top of the Windows operating system and IIS (Internet Information Server). It was always a separate entity, and therefore its functionality was limited. ASP.NET, on the other hand, is an integral part of the system under the .NET Framework. It shares many 9f the same objects that traditional applications would use and all .NET objects available for ASP. NET’s consumption.
*   Instead of being limited to six inherent objects in ASP, ASP.NET has a plethora of useful components it can build form_._
*   ASP also made it abundantly clear that client and server were two separate entities, Whereas ASP. NET ties together the client and the server through clever use of server-side and client-side code, all invisible to the developer.
*   ASP.NET code is compiled, whereas classic ASP used interpreted scripting languages. Using compiled code means an automatic boost in performance over ASP applications.
*   In classic ASP, nearly all of the code was executed in code render blocks (that is, inside &lt;%...%&gt; tags). In ASP.NET, this type of code isn’t compiled and isn’t recommended _for_ frequent use. Instead, you use the code declaration blocks, which are compiled and provide better performance.

Following are some of the significant new features of ASP.NET:

*   ASP.NET uses compiled code written in Common Language Runtime languages such as Visual Basic and C#. Unlike previous versions of Active Server Pages, this version does not use interpreted scripting languages such as VBScript.
*   ASP.NET pages are built out of server-side controls. Web server controls enable you to represent and program against Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) elements using an intuitive object model.
*   ASP.NET includes a new technology called Web Services. You can use Web Services to access methods and properties and transfer database data across the Internet.

**DBMS**

SQL SERVER:

SQL Server is an SQL-compliant RDBMS. SQL-compliant means it use the ANSI (American National Standard Institute) version of Structured Query Language or ‘SQL’. Structured Query Language is a command that allow us to modify or retrieve information from the database.
