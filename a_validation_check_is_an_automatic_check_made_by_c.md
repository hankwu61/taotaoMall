## **_A validation check is an automatic check made by computer to ensure that any data entered into the computer is sensible. A validation check does not make sure that data has been entered correctly. It only ensures that data is sensible. For this reason validation checks are not usually as effective as verification checks. They can however be carried out automatically by the computer and therefore require less work by the computer operators making them cheaper to use._** {#a-validation-check-is-an-automatic-check-made-by-computer-to-ensure-that-any-data-entered-into-the-computer-is-sensible-a-validation-check-does-not-make-sure-that-data-has-been-entered-correctly-it-only-ensures-that-data-is-sensible-for-this-reason-validation-checks-are-not-usually-as-effective-as-verification-checks-they-can-however-be-carried-out-automatically-by-the-computer-and-therefore-require-less-work-by-the-computer-operators-making-them-cheaper-to-use}
