## **_Operational Feasibility_** {#operational-feasibility}

A proposed system is beneficial only if it can be turned into an information system that will meet the operational requirements of an organization. A system often fails if it does not fit within existing operations and if users resist the change.

Important issues a systems developer must look into are:

*   Will the new system be used if implemented in an organization?
*   Are there major barriers to implementation or is proposed system accepted without destructive resistance?

The whole purpose of computerizing the Placement System is to handle the work much more accurately and efficiently with less time consumption. There will be additional work to be completed, because now the students and the companies can update their resumes and profiles online. Their database is maintained separately.

Compared to the semi-computerized system the chances of avoiding errors in a computerized system is much higher because the user need not stress himself unnecessarily resulting in recklessness. Unlike the semi-computerized system there would be backup data for all the information concerning the daily transactions occurred within the organization.

If we are considering the performance and response time for each task, it is very much faster since there is less paper work to be completed. When entering data into the system to relieve the user from additional work and typing incorrect data, the system provides options such as combo boxes, check boxes, option buttons and etc. if the users type in incorrect data they would be informed immediately about the error by the error detection control.

Another important fact to be regarded is the security control, which is handled by the system. Since data regarding each student and the company is confidential, security is a key issue. Information falling into the wrong hands could jeopardize the entire organization. Unlike in semi-computerized systems the proposed system offers adequate control to protect the organization against fraud and embezzlement and guarantees the accuracy and security of data and information. This is handled by the system providing each department and individuals with separate login names and passwords.

The new system is more user-friendly, which enables the end-user to complete his/her work efficiently and accurately with interest. After taking the above fact into consideration we can state the operating of the proposed system within the organization is feasible.

In this phase of the feasibility study the following two main topics

*   Technical Performance Aspect
*   Acceptance within the organization

Technical performance aspect is explained in the technical feasibility report and there is no new information is needed in this to explain it again, but as for the acceptance within the organization the following points are important and those are explained according to the topics

1.  Whether the system provides right information to the right place.

In the current system which is the semi computerized system the information may be lost in the process of sending from one place to another. This is mainly due to human interaction in the process of the transferring information from one place to another.

1.  Whether the new system affect the current users in the system

The new proposed system will affect the users in the following areas

*   *   Accuracy
    *   Efficiency
    *   Productivity
    *   Robustness
    *   Lesser time consuming

System Security

System security is a vital aspect when it comes to developing a system. The system should ensure the facility of preventing unauthorized personnel from accessing the information and the data within the system. The system should provide total protection for each user’s information so that the integrity of data is sustained and also prevent hackers from hacking the system.

The proposed system ensures the security and the integrity of data. This is done by providing a password login system for each authorized users. And for example the System Administrator has access to all kinds of information.

By providing this facility information is properly managed and information is protected. For example the system administrator’s day to day tasks are lessened and easier because he doesn’t have to have a constant eye on the system and worry about hackers hacking the system.

Economical And Financial Feasibility

In making recommendations a study of the economics of the proposed system should be made. The proposed system must be justifiable in terms of cost and benefit, to ensure that the investment in a new/changed system provide a reasonable return.

Cost-benefit analysis of information is complicated by the fact that many of the systems cost elements are poorly defined and that benefit can often be highly qualitative and subjective in nature.

In our proposed system various costs are evaluated. Even though finding out the costs of the proposed project is difficult we and assume and estimate the costs and benefits as follows.

According to the computerized system we propose, the costs can be broken down to two categories.

1.  Costs associated with the development of the system.
2.  Costs associated with operating the system.

Software Requirement Specification

The software requirement specification is produced at the culmination of the analysis task. The function and performance allocated to software as part of system engineering are refined by establishing a complete information description, a detailed functional description, a representation of system behavior, an indication of performance requirement and design constraints appropriate validation criteria, and other information pertinent to requirement.

The introduction to software requirements specification states the goals and objectives of the software, describing it in the context of the computer based system.

The Information Description provides a detailed description of the problem that the software must solve. Information content, flow and structure are documented.

A description of each function required to solve the problem is presented in the Functional Description.

Validation Criteria is probably the most important and ironically the most often neglected section of the software requirement specification.

Software requirement specification can be used for different purpose. Here are the major uses.

not clearly understood by the developer. If this is the case, a careful analysis – involving much interaction with the user should be devoted to reaching a clear statement of requirements, in order to avoid possible misunderstandings.

Sometimes, at the beginning of a project, even the user has no clear idea of what exactly the desired product is. Think for instance of user interface , a user with no previous experience with computer products may not appreciate the difference between , say menu driven interaction and a command line interface. Even an exact formation of system functions and performance may be missing an initial description produced by an inexperienced user.

A statement of the requirements for the implementation:

Specifications are also used as a reference point during product implementation. In fact, the ultimate goal of the implementation is to build a product that needs specification. Thus the implementers use specifications during design to make design decisions and during the verification activity to check that the implementation compiles with specifications.
