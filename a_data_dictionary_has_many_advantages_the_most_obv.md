## **_A data dictionary has many advantages. The most obvious is documentation; it is valuable reference in any organization. Another advantage is improving analyst/user communication by establishing consistent definition of various elements, terms and procedures.

Also control information maintained for each data element is cross referenced in the data dictionary. E.g. program that use a given data element are cross referenced in a data dictionary, which makes it easy to identify them and make any necessary changes.
