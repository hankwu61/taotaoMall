## **_DATA DICTIONARY:_** {#data-dictionary}

In our DFD, we give names to data flows, processes, and data stores. Although the names are descriptive of the data, they do not give details. So the following the DFD, our interest is to build some structured place to keep details of the contents of data flow, processes, and data store. A data dictionary is a structured repository of data about data. It is a set of rigorous definition of all DFD data element and data structure.
