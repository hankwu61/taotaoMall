## _LANGUAGES USED_ {#languages-used}

Why .NET?

*   1.  Interoperability between languages and execution environments
    2.  Uniformity in schema or formats for Data Exchange using XML, XSL
    3.  Extend or use existing code that is valid
    4.  Programming complexity of environment is reduced

The .NET Framework is…

1.  A component model for the internet
2.  The new approach to building large scale distributed systems for the Internet
3.  Provides the capability to integrate multiple devices
4.  Built around the tools and protocols (XML, WSDL, SOAP, HTTP) that are becoming standard on the Internet

The .NET in ASP.NET stands for the .NET Framework, a set of objects and blueprints from Microsoft for building applications. All applications developed under the .NET Framework; including ASP.NET applications, have certain key features that ensure compatibility, security, and stability.

Common Language Runtime (CLR) is an environment that manages the execution of code. With the .NET Framework and CLR, we write code and compile it. However, instead of compiling it into the computer understands, we compile it into a language called Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL). When we compile to MSIL, your application produce something called metadata. This is descriptive information about your application. It tells what the application can do, where it belongs, and so on. When you want to run your program, the CLR takes over and compile the code once more into the computer’s native language. This way MSIL can go on any type of computer. The CLR can speak many different computer languages and does all the compiling _for_ you. Once you compile your application, you can bring it to any other computer. CLR also provides services such as error handling, security features, versioning and deployment support, as well as cross-language integration. That means we can choose any language we want to write our .NET applications, including ASP.NET applications.

The .NET Framework Design Goals

1\. Component Development for the Internet

2\. &quot;Cross-Language Development”

3\. Inheritance, Debugging, Exception handling

4\. Reliability and Security

5\. Simple Development and Deployment

6\. Device-agnostic
