## **_The databases are implemented using a DBMS package. Each particular DBMS has unique characteristics and general techniques for Database Design._** {#the-databases-are-implemented-using-a-dbms-package-each-particular-dbms-has-unique-characteristics-and-general-techniques-for-database-design}

The proposed Management Information System stores the information relevant for processing in the Microsoft SQL Server Database. This MS SQL Server contains tables, where each table is called a field or column. A table also contains records which is a set of fields. All records, in a table the same set of fields with different information. Each table contains key fields that establish relationships in a MS SQL server database and how the records are stored. There are primary key fields that uniquely identify a record in a table. There are also fields that contain the primary key from another table called foreign keys.

It is a known fact that the program cannot be written until the data are defined, so the database must be defined. The starting point for this process is data dictionary. The records data structures and elements to be stored in each database are identified and extracted.
