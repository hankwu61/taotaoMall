**PREFACE**

Effective management of projects is vital for the development of economy because development itself is the effect of series of successful managed projects. This makes project management extremely important problem area for developing economy such as ours. Unfortunately many projects experience schedule slippage and cost overruns due to variety of reasons. To remedy the situation, a project has to be meticulously planned, effectively implemented and professionally managed to achieve the objective of the time, cost and performance. Computerization of the project management can play a major role in streamlining the management of project. Thus we see the computer becoming necessity in the day to day life. The use of computer also involves the feeling of healthy competition with the organization receiving much attention these days. Almost everyday uses of paper carry advertisements asking for project managers. The scenario was not so bright a few years back. For that matter even today though lots of seminars are held on project management, name of the universities in India offer any course to students to formally qualify as project managers. Thus, while there is very little supply. This has created all sorts of problems. Project management, unfortunately, is not but project manager practice, our attempts to demonstrate how project management, as it is concerned, can be put into practice.

**ACKNOWLEDGEMENT**

We would first like to thank God for showering his kind blessings on us. We owe deep gratitude to our college H.O.D Dr R.B Patel, for being helpful and encouraging all the time. We would also like to thank our Training &amp; Placement teacher Mrs. Santosh Bhardhwaj (Programmer) for extending his kind support and guidance throughout the training period July 2009 to September 2009 and from the bottom of our heart in helping us in the learning process and being the constant source of motivation. Besides our respected teacher mentioned, we would also like to thank all the staff at DOEACC, we came in contact at DOEACC with during our training period, for their helpful and kind nature. Last but not the least, we are grateful to our parents for being so supportive and constantly inspiring us to perform better.

INTODUCTION

TO

C#

**INTRODUCTION TO C#**

Let’s look at the key building blocks of .NET and some related technologies.

*   _C#, a new language_

C# is the first component oriented language in the C and C++ family of languages. It is a simple, modern, object oriented and type- safe programming language derived from C and C++. C# combines the high productivity of Microsoft Visual Basic and the raw power of C++.

*   _Common language runtime_

The high performance common language runtime includes as execution engine, a garbage collector, post in time compilation, a security system, and a rich class framework (the .NET Framework). The runtime was designed from the ground up to support multiple languages.

*   _Common language Specification_

The Common Language Specification (CLS) describes a common level of language functionality. The relatively high minimum bar of the CLS enables the creation of a club of CLS compliant languages. Each member of the club enjoys dual benefit: complete access to .NET functionality and rich interoperability with other compliant languages. For e.g. a Visual Basic class can inherit from a C# class and override its virtual methods.

*   _A Rich Set Of Languages That Target The Runtime_

Microsoft provided languages that target the runtime include Visual Basic, Visual C++ with Managed Extensions,

Visual C# and J Script. Third parties are providing many other languages- too many to list he
