## **_In database design, several views of data must be considered along with the persons who use them. In addition to data structuring, where relationships are reflected between and within entities, we need to identify the application programâ€™s logical views of data within an overall logical data structure. The logical view is what the data look like, regardless of how they are stored. The physical view is the way data exist in physical storage. It deals with hoe data are stored, accessed, or related to other data in storage._** {#in-database-design-several-views-of-data-must-be-considered-along-with-the-persons-who-use-them-in-addition-to-data-structuring-where-relationships-are-reflected-between-and-within-entities-we-need-to-identify-the-application-program-s-logical-views-of-data-within-an-overall-logical-data-structure-the-logical-view-is-what-the-data-look-like-regardless-of-how-they-are-stored-the-physical-view-is-the-way-data-exist-in-physical-storage-it-deals-with-hoe-data-are-stored-accessed-or-related-to-other-data-in-storage}
